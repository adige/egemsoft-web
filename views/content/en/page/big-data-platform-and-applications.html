<p>Big data, as the name recalls, is usually interpreted as the datasets that are too large and complex. Egemsoft has determined big data technologies as the strategic platform for the research and application development activities.  </p>
<p>These two factors alone, challenge the traditional data management and analysis tools commonly utilised by the enterprises today. On top of that, the sources of data are numerous; data in the form of text from social media, structured data from corporate applications, video signals from survelliance cameras, call center logs, cell phone talks and browsing patterns of web users and many more.</p>
<p>The information has always been there but the ability to enrich the variety of information and to dig more to extract more insight, has become the new challenge for corporates for a sustainable competitive advantage. As there is the opportunity, there resides the risk as well. Investing more and more on hardware and software, most likely will result in an endless loop and in unpredictable operational costs.</p>
<p><strong>Data correlation gives the opportunity to;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get Indepth Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse your customers from different perspectives</li>
<li>Create customer segments more accurately by using diverse metrics</li>
<li>Learn what they are thinking and talking about</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Design and Develop Personalised Services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Correlate customer information from several aspects and find the most suitable products for each and every customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Act On Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand customers’ requirements on time, present what they need when they need it</li>
<li>Act on customer trends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce Churn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify customers facing bad experiences</li>
<li>Find customers that are having bad SLAs</li>
<li>Learn customers with tendency to churn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Effective Resource Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify customers facing bad experiences</li>
<li>Find customers that are having bad SLAs</li>

<p><strong>Big Data Technologies - Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Complements Existing Data Management Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not a rival or an alternative to DWH or RDBMSs; it is complemantary</li>
<li>«Cold Data» can be placed on BigData stacks. Reduces load on existing systems, still providing live access to data</li>
<li>Process, cleanse and structure big and unstructured data before DWH/RDBMS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Pre-Modelling Effort</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Store the data as is; no formatting, no pre-processing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a quick start: defer data-modelling or cleansing to later stages  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Correct Tools to Process Low Value per TB Data Stacks</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower cost solution to store &amp; query the regulatory data; Don’t need to use valuable DWH resources</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right tool to process the data that is left behind due to low value</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Scalability</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Start small, grow as you require</p>
</li>
<li>Don’t lose your starting investment, scale horizontally</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these advantages, adapting big data technologies has some important challanges.</p>
<p><strong>Big Data Technologies - Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of End-to-End Solutions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tens of technologies combined together mean a value</li>
<li>Integration of these technologies require extensive software engineering skills</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not End User Friendly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Business users need to write Java, Pig or Hive scripts to analyse the data</li>
<li>Needs more tools to make big data technologies more business user friendly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Parallel Environment Hurdles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Big data technologies provide great powers to process big data stacks in parallel</li>
<li>Managing parallel jobs, tens/hundreds of nodes and resources requires the right tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Egemsoft Big Data Management Platform has been designed and developed to address these challenges and offer an infrastructure to institutions which can be adapted with a high ROI ratio.</p>
<p>The architectural design of the platform is as follows:</p>
